# You Need a Budget - in React

![sup](http://media1.giphy.com/media/yWJI9tPcrgsj6/giphy.gif)

I love the web app [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/).  It's a money management software that has been a game changer for me. 

This will be my attempt to re-write the front-end as a component driven, mobile first web app...all in React!
(Not guts, just front-end.  Back end stuff is just not my currency.)

It's one of my goals to work with them––in the mean time, I'll do this. :)

Based on my [react-es6-postcss-boilerplate](https://github.com/RVMendoza/react-es6-postcss-boilerplate).

I will explain better later, but basically fork this, `npm install` and then `npm start`.
